                        <p>(ii) The ligands are then placed in alphabetical order. The placement
                            of a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.</p>
                            <p>(iii) Polydentate ligands are also placed alphabetically. In case of
                                abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to
                                determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.</p>
                                <p>(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or
                                    not, is enclosed in square brackets.When ligands are polyatomic,
                                    their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligands abbreviations
                                    are also enclosed in parentheses.</p>
                                    <p>(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal
                                        within a coordination sphere.</p>
                                        <p>(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written
                                            without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the

                                            <p>(vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the

                        <p>(i) Like simple salts the cation is named first in both positively and
                            negatively charged coordination entities.</p>
                            <p>(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order (according to the
                                name of ligand, not the prefix) before the name of the central
                                atom/ion.</p>
                                <p>(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in o and those of neutral ligands
                                    are the same except aqua for H<su>2</su>O, ammine for NH<sub>3</sub>, carbonyl for
                                    CO, thiocarbonyl for CS and nitrosyl forNO. But names of cationic
                                    ligands end inium.</p>
                                    <p>(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the
                                        one kind of ligands in the coordination entity.When the names of
                                        the ligands include a numerical prefix or are complicated or
                                        whenever the use of normal prefixes creates some confusion, it is
                                        set off in parentheses and the second set of prefixes is used.</p>

                                        <p>(v) Oxidation state of themetal in cation, anion or neutral coordination
                                            entity is indicated byRoman numeral in the parentheses after the
                                            name of metal.</p>
                                            <p>(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the
                                                element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt
                                                and Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the
                                                name of themetal ends with the suffix - ate. For example, Co in a
                                                complex anion, [Co(SCN)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> is called cobaltate. For somemetals,
                                                the Latin names are used in the complex anions.</p>

                                                <p>(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the
                                                    complex cation.</p>

                            The plane formed by the four ligating atoms and themetal ion is considered
                            to be a mirror plane and thus prevents the possibility of chirality.</p>

                        <p>Compounds of metals with CO as a ligand are called metal carbonyls.
                            They are of two types.</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) Monomeric :</strong> Those metal carbonyls which contain only one metal atom
                                per molecule are called monomeric carbonyls. For examples : [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>]
                                (sp<sub>3</sub>, tetrahedral); [Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> ] (dsp<sup>3</sup>, trigonal bipyramidal).</p>
                        <p><strong>(b) Polymeric :</strong> Those metal carbonyls which contain two or more than two
                                    metal atoms per molecule and they have metal-metal bonds are called
                                    polymeric carbonyl. For example : Mn<sub>2</sub> (CO)1<sub>10</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>, etc.</p>
                        <p>The MC bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from a
                                        filled d orbital of metal into the vacant antibonding * orbital of carbon
                                        monoxide. Thus carbon monoxide acts as  donor (OCM) and a 
                                        acceptor (OCM), with the two interactions creating a synergic effect
                                        which strengthens the bond between CO and the metal as shown in
                                        figure.</p>
