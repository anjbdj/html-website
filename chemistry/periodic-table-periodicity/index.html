                        <p><strong>(a) Dobereiners Triads :</strong> He arranged similar elements in the groups of
                            three elements called as triads</p>
                            <p><strong>(b) Newlands Law of Octave :</strong>  He was the first to correlate the chemical
                                properties of the elements with their atomic masses.</p>
                                <p><strong>(c) Lother Meyers Classification :</strong> He plotted a graph between atomic
                                    masses against their respective atomic volumes for a number of elements.
                                    He found the observations ;</p>
                                <p>(i) elements with similar properties occupied similar positions on the curve,</p>
                                <p>(ii) alkalimetals having larger atomic volumes occupied the crests,</p>
                                            <p>(iii) transitions elements occupied the troughs,</p>

                                                the halogens occupied the ascending portions of the curve before the
                                                inert gases and</p>
                            <p>(v) alkaline earthmetals occupied the positions at about themid points of
                                                    the descending portions of the curve. On the basis of these observations
                                                    he concluded that the atomic volumes (a physical property) of the elements
                                                    are the periodic functions of their atomic masses.</p>

                        <p>on descending a group, the atoms and ions increase in size. On
                            moving from left to right in the periodic table, the size decreases.
                            Thus on moving diagonally, the size remains nearly the same.

                        <p><strong>Size of the Atom :</strong> Ionisation energy decreases with increase in atomic
                            size.</p>
                            <p><strong>Nuclear Charge :</strong> The ionisation energy increases with increase in the
                                nuclear charge.</p>
                                <p><strong>Shielding or screening effect :</strong> The larger the number of electrons in
                                    the inner shells, greater is the screening effect and smaller the force of
                                    attraction and thus ionization energy (IE) decreases.</p>

                                        follows the order s > p > d > f for, the same energy level. Higher the
                                        penetration of electron higher will be the ionisation energy.</p>
