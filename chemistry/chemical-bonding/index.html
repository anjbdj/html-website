                            moves only slowly. In contrast, Cs<sup>+</sup> is the least hydrated because of its
                            bigger size and thus the radius of the Cs<sup>+</sup> ion is smaller than the radius of
                            hydrated Li<sup>+</sup>, and hence hydrated Cs<sup>+</sup> moves faster, and conducts
                            electricity more readily.</p>

                                (head-on) overlap of bonding orbitals along the internuclear axis.</p>

                                            extent. Hence, it is stronger as compared to the pi bond where the extent
                                            of overlapping occurs to a smaller extent.</p>

                        <p>(i) The shape of amolecule depends upon the number of valence shell electron

                            <p>(ii) Pairs of electrons in the valence shell repel one another since their electron
                                clouds are negatively charged.</p>
                                <p>(iii) These pairs of electrons tend to occupy such positions in space that
                                    minimise repulsion and thus maximise distance between them.</p>
                                    <p>(iv) The valence shell is taken as a sphere with the electron pairs localising on
                                        the spherical surface atmaximum distance from one another.</p>
                                        <p>(v) A multiple bond is treated as if it is a single electron pair and the two or
                                            three electron pairs of a multiple bond are treated as a single super pair.</p>

                        <p>1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to the number of the atomic orbitals
                            that get hybridised.</p>
                            <p>2. The hybridised orbitals are always equivalent in energy and shape.</p>
                            <p>3. The hybrid orbitals are more effective in forming stable bonds than the
                                pure atomic orbitals.</p>
                                <p>4. These hybrid orbitals are directed in space in some preferred direction to
                                    have minimum repulsion between electron pairs and thus a stable
                                    arrangement is obtained. Therefore, the type of hybridisation indicates the

                        <p>developed by F. Hund and R.S. Mulliken in 1932.</p>
                        <p>(i) Molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of atomic orbitals of
                            comparable energies and proper symmetry.</p>
                            <p>(ii) An electron in an atomic orbital is influenced by one nucleus, while in a
                                molecular orbital it is influenced by two ormore nuclei depending upon the
                                number of the atoms in the molecule.<strong>Thus an atomic orbital is
                                    monocentric while a molecular orbital is polycentric.</strong></p>
                                    <p>(iii) The number ofmolecular orbitals formed is equal to the number of combining
                                        atomic orbitals.When two atomic orbitals combine, twomolecular orbitals
                                        called<strong>bondingmolecular orbital</strong>and<strong>anti-bondingmolecular orbital</strong>are formed.</p>
                                        <p>(iv) Themolecular orbitals like the atomic orbitals are filled in accordance with
                                            the<strong>Aufbau principle</strong>obeying the<strong>Pauli Exclusion principle</strong>and the<strong>Hunds Rule of Maximum Multiplicity.</strong>But the filling order of these
                                            molecular orbitals is always<strong>experimentally decided,</strong>there is no rule

                        <p> <strong>(a) Electron deficient bonding:</strong> There are many compounds in which
                            some electron deficient bonds are present apart from normal covalent
                            bonds or coordinate bonds. These electron deficient bonds have less
                            number of electrons than the expected such as three centre-two electron
                            bonds (3c-2e) present in diborane B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, BeH<sub>2</sub>(s) and bridging
                            metal carbonyls.</p>
                            <p> <strong>(b) Back Bonding :</strong> Back bonding generally takes place when out of two
                                bonded atoms one of the atom has vacant orbitals (generally this atom is
                                from second or third period) and the other bonded atom is having some
                                non-bonded electron pair(generally this atom is from the second period).
                                Back bonding increases the bond strength and decreases the bond length.
                                For example, in BF<sub>3</sub></p>
