                        <p>The compound of ametal found in nature is called amineral. Theminerals
                            from which metal can be economically and conveniently extracted are
                            called<strong>ores</strong> . An ore is usually contaminated with earthy or undesired
                            materials known as gangue.</p>
                            <p><strong>(a) Native ores</strong> contain the metal in free state. Silver, gold, platinum etc,
                                occur as native ores.</p>
                                <p><strong>(b) Oxidised ores</strong> consist of oxides or oxysalts (e.g. carbonates, phosphates,
                                    sulphates and silicates ) of metals.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(c) Sulphurised ores</strong> consist of sulphides of metals like iron, lead, zinc,
                                        mercury etc.</p>
                                        <p><strong>(d) Halide ores</strong> consist of halides of metals.</p>

                        <p>The scientific and technological process used for the extraction/isolation
                            of the metal from its ore is called as metallurgy.</p>
                            <p>The isolation and extraction ofmetals from their ores involve the following
                                major steps:</p>
                                <p><strong>(A) Crushing and Grinding :</strong> The ore is first crushed by jaw crushers and
                                    ground to a powder.</p>
                                    <p class="heading">(B) Concentration :</p>
                                    <p>The removal of unwanted useless impurities fromthe ore is called <strong>dressing,
                                        concentration or benefaction of ore.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="heading">(i) Hydraulic washing or Gravity separation or Levigation method :</p>
                        <p>It is based on the difference in the densities of the gangue and ore particles.
                            This method is generally used for the concentration of oxide and native
                            ores.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <p>It is based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore components.
                            Chromite ore(FeO.Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is separated from nonmagnetic silicious
                            impurities and cassiterite ore(SnO<sub>2</sub>) is separated frommagneticWolframite
                            (FeWO<ssub>4</ssub> +MnWO<sub>4</sub>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="heading">(iii) Froth floatation process.</p>
                        <p>Thismethod is commonlyused for the concentration
                            of the low grade sulphide ores like galena, PbS (ore of Pb); copper pyrites
                            Cu<sub>2</sub>S.Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> or CuFeS<sub>2</sub> (ore of copper) ; zinc blende, ZnS (ore of zinc) etc.,
                            and is based on the fact that gangue and ore particles have different degree
                            of wettabilitywithwater and pine oil; the gangue particles are preferentially
                            wetted by water while the ore particles are wetted by oil. In this process
                            one or more chemical frothing agents are added.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>(iv) Leaching</strong>: Leaching is often used if the ore is soluble in some suitable
                            solvent, e.g, acids, bases and suitable chemical reagents.</p>
                            <p class="heading">(C) Extraction of crude metal from concentrated ore :</p>
                            <p>The isolation ofmetals fromconcentrated ore involves twomajor steps as
                                given below.</p>

                        <p class="heading">(i) Conversion to oxide :</p>
                        <p><strong>Calcination.</strong>strong It is a process of heating the concentrated ore strongly in a
                            limited supply of air or in the absence of air. The process of calcination
                            brings about the following changes :</p>
                            <p><strong>(a)</strong> The carbonate ore gets decomposed to form the oxide of the metal.</p>
                            <p><strong>(b)</strong> Water of crystallisation present in the hydrated oxide ore gets lost as
                                moisture.</p>
                                <p><strong>(c)</strong>Organicmatter, if present in the ore, gets expelled and the ore becomes
                                    porous. Volatile impurities are removed.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p class="heading">Roasting :</p>
                        <p>It is a process of heating the concentrated ore (generally sulphide ore)
                            strongly in the excess of air or O<sub>2</sub> below its melting point. Roasting is an
                            exothermic process once started it does not require additional heating.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="heading">Smelting :</p>
                        <p><strong>Slag formation :</strong> In many extraction processes, an oxide is added
                            deliberately to combine with other impurities and form a stable molten
                            phase immiscible withmoltenmetal called a slag. The process is termed
                            smelting.</p>
                            <p>The principle of slag formation is essentially the following :
                                Nonmetal oxide (acidic oxide) + Metal oxide (basic oxide) --> Fusible
                                (easilymelted) slag</p>
                                <p>Removal of unwanted basic and acidic oxides: For example, FeO is the
                                    impurity in extraction of Cu from copper pyrite.</p>

                                    <p>Matte also contains a very small amount of iron(II) sulphide.
                                        To remove unwanted acidic impurities like sand and P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, smelting is
                                        done in the presence of limestone.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reduction with CO :</strong> In some cases CO produced in the furnace itself is

                            <p>Metallic oxides (Cr and Mn) can be reduced by a highly electropositive
                                metal such as aluminium that liberates a large amount of energy (1675
                                kJ/mol) on oxidation to AI<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The process is known as Goldschmidt or</p>

                                <p><strong>Magnesium reduction method :</strong> Magnesium is used in similar way to
                                    reduce oxides. In certain cases where the oxide is too stable to reduce,
                                    electropositivemetals are used to reduce halides.</p>

                                    Copper and zinc are obtained by electrolysis of aqueous solution of their

                        <p><strong>(I) Liquation process :</strong> This process is used for the purification of the
                            metal, which itself is readily fusible, but the impurities present in it are
                            not, used for the purification of Sn and Zn, and for removing Pb fromZn-Ag
                            alloy.</p>
                            <p><strong>(II) Fractional distillation process :</strong> This process is used to purify those
                                metals which themselves are volatile and the impurities in them are
                                nonvolatile and vice-versa. Zn, Cd and Hg are purified by this process.</p>
                                <p><strong>(III) Zone refining method (Fractional crystallisation method) :</strong> This
                                    process is used when metals are required in very high purity, for specific
                                    application. For example pure Si and Ge are used in semiconductors</p>
